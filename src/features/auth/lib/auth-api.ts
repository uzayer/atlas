// JWT never cross this boundary. What arrives here is `AuthSnapshot`, which
// carries identity and nothing secret. That split is deliberate — the renderer
// runs with no CSP and also displays agent-authored markdown, so a token in
// this heap would be one injection away from being exfiltrated.
//
// See src-tauri/src/auth for the state machine and src-tauri/src/commands/auth
// for the adapters.
