/**
 * Flush registry — the "save all pending UI state" coordinator used when
 * switching or closing workspaces (and on app quit).
 *
 * Many stores persist project-scoped state to `<project>/.atlas/*.json`
 * through their own *debounced* `invoke(...)` writes. None of them expose a
 * way to (a) cancel the pending debounce and (b) await the resulting write.
 * Without that, switching workspaces could drop the last few edits that were
 * still sitting in a debounce timer.
 *
 * Each store registers a `flush()` that MUST: cancel its debounce timer,
 * perform the save immediately, and return a promise that resolves only once
 * the underlying `invoke` settles. `flushAll()` awaits every registered
 * flush. It is intentionally resilient — one store throwing never blocks the
 * others (and therefore never blocks a workspace switch).
