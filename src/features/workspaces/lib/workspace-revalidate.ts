/**
 * Stale-while-revalidate for warm workspace switches.
 *
 * After `restoreSnapshot` paints the cached UI instantly, we kick a
 * NON-BLOCKING background refresh of the cheap-but-possibly-stale data (git
 * status, explorer tree, analysis symbols). Steady-state freshness also arrives
 * via the resident watchers (`atlas:git-changed`, `atlas:explorer:changed`),
 * so this mainly covers changes that happened while the workspace was
 * backgrounded.
 *
 * Generation guard: we capture the active workspace id at dispatch and re-check
 * it right before each refresh applies, so a rapid A→B→A doesn't let B's late
 * refresh clobber A. Authoritative-in-RAM stores (layout/editor/terminal/chat/
 * knowledge) are intentionally NOT revalidated — reloading them would discard
 * live/unsaved state.
