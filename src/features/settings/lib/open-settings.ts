/**
 * Open the Settings tab already showing `section`.
 *
 * Both channels are used, because the panel has two ways of arriving at a
 * section and only one of them covers each case:
 *
 * - `data.section` becomes the panel's initial state, so a tab opened fresh
 *   *renders* on the right section. Without it the panel mounts on General and
 *   swaps a frame later — a visible flash on the common path.
 * - The nav store reaches a panel that is **already mounted** on another
 *   section, where the initial state has long since been read.
 *
 * Setting one without the other leaves half the ticket's requirement working.
