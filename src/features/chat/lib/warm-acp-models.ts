// Background model-list warming for the ACP agents (Claude Code / Codex).
//
// Models are advertised in a `session/new` response, so the only way to learn
// them is to open a session. To make the model picker instant — and to let the
// user switch to the *other* agent with its models already populated — we warm
// each agent's model list in the background and persist it (acp-models-cache):
//
//   • When a chat is active on agent A, warm the OTHER ACP agent (so a switch is
//     instant the first time too).
//   • On Atlas startup, silently refresh the agents we've cached before
//     (optimistic UI: the cache drives the picker, this just keeps it fresh).
//
// The harvested session has no tab bound to it (the frontend never createSession's
// it), so it's invisible to the UI and never persisted (no turn runs). Agents are
// pooled per plugin, so this is one cheap extra ACP session per agent per launch.
