 * Recognising bash/shell tool calls is subtle because the two ingest paths
 * label them differently:
 *   - Live ACP stream (`manager.rs`): `toolName` is the ACP *title*, which for
 *     Bash is the command itself (e.g. `npm install`), and `kind` is "execute".
 *   - Reloaded transcript (`transcript.rs`): `toolName` is the Claude Code tool
 *     name "Bash"; `kind` is mapped to "execute" on replay.
 * So the reliable signal is `kind === "execute"`, with a tool-name fallback for
 * any agent that doesn't set a kind.
