//! The single-owner session actor.
//!
//! One tokio task per session multiplexes, in a single `tokio::select!` loop,
//! two inputs:
//!
//! - `control_rx` — user intents (send / cancel / respond-permission / set-*),
//! - `stream_rx`  — a FIFO of `ActorMsg`: inbound agent events (`Acp`) pushed by
//!   the manager's event routing, AND the turn-completion signal (`TurnDone`)
//!   pushed by the spawned prompt task when `AgentConnection::prompt` resolves.
//!
//! Both the streamed events and the completion travel through the **same FIFO**,
//! and (for ACP) the driver reads all of a turn's `session/update` frames before
//! the `session/prompt` response frame — so ordinarily `TurnDone` sits *behind*
//! the last content event and no `activity_seq` poll or quiescence heuristic is
//! needed.
//!
//! That ordering is an assertion, not a guarantee: `TurnDone` is posted by the
//! spawned prompt task while content events are routed from a *different* task,
//! and Claude Code's bridge can resolve `session/prompt` (`end_turn`) while tool
//! calls are still in flight. So finalization is additionally **gated on tool
//! quiescence** — per the ACP contract that a turn only truly ends once no tool
//! calls pend. If a `TurnDone` arrives with non-terminal tool calls, the result
//! is stashed in `pending_finalize` and the terminal is deferred until the last
//! `tool_call_update` reports done (a bounded [`FinalizeTimeout`] backstop keeps
//! a never-terminating tool from hanging the turn). This closes the "idle while
//! tools still spinning" race at the authoritative Rust layer.
//!
//! A monotonic [`TurnId`] + `is_same_turn` check makes preemption safe: a new
//! `Send` bumps the id, so a superseded turn's late `TurnDone` is dropped and
//! can't flip a fresh turn's status.
