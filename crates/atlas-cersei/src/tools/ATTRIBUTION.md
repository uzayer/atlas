The replacer engine in `replace.rs` (the 9-strategy fallback ladder behind the
`Edit` tool — `Simple`, `LineTrimmed`, `BlockAnchor`, `WhitespaceNormalized`,
`IndentationFlexible`, `EscapeNormalized`, `TrimmedBoundary`, `ContextAware`,
`MultiOccurrence`), the driver's uniqueness + disproportionate-match guard, and
the corrective error strings in `errors.rs`, the read pagination/`Did you mean?`
logic in `read.rs`, and the output-truncation spill in `truncate.rs` are ported
to Rust from **opencode** (MIT):

- opencode — `packages/opencode/src/tool/edit.ts`, `read.ts`, `grep.ts`,
  `glob.ts`, `truncate.ts` — https://github.com/sst/opencode (MIT License)

opencode's edit strategies are themselves derived from:

- **Cline** — `evals/diff-edits/diff-apply/*` — https://github.com/cline/cline (Apache-2.0)
- **Gemini CLI** — `packages/core/src/utils/editCorrector.ts` —
  https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli (Apache-2.0)

The Rust port is original code; only the algorithms, strategy ordering, and
error-message wording were adapted. The 2026 destructive-match guard and the
auto-apply vs. guarded-fuzzy-tail split follow opencode's hardening (see
`plans/atlas-cersei-edit-solution.md`).
