//! On-disk credential storage.
//!
//! The session token lives in `atlas-session.json` in the app's private config
//! directory, mode `0600`, in **its own file** separate from `byok-keys.json`
//! so that signing out is a single unlink.
//!
//! ## Why not the OS keychain
//!
//! `docs/api/atlas-auth-api.md` §12.5 says to put this in the keychain. We
//! knowingly do not, for the same reason `commands::byok` does not: on macOS an
//! unsigned, frequently-rebuilt binary prompts for keychain permission on
//! *every* access. `tauri.conf.json` sets no signing identity, and the
//! auto-updater replaces the binary on every release — which invalidates the
//! keychain ACL and would re-prompt every user after every update. Keychain is
//! therefore *worse* in release than in development here.
//!
//! Revisit once a real Developer ID signing identity is configured; that also
//! fixes the auto-update ACL problem.
//!
//! The access JWT is never written here — it is minted on demand and held in
//! memory only.
