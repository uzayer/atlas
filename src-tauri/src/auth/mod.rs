//! Atlas account authentication (ATL-35).
//!
//! The desktop is an untrusted OAuth client: it has no cookie and no redirect
//! URI, so it connects via the **OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant**
//! (RFC 8628) — show a code, let the human approve it in a real browser, poll
//! for the result. See `docs/api/atlas-auth-api.md` §7 in the server repo.
//!
//! Everything here is deliberately free of Tauri types. The whole module is
//! driven through [`AuthCore`], constructed from an auth base URL, a config
//! directory, and an HTTP client — which is what lets the tests point it at a
//! stub server on loopback with a temporary directory and exercise the real
//! client, the real poll loop, and the real file I/O. The Tauri commands in
//! `commands::auth` are thin adapters that translate and emit events.
//!
//! Every authenticated call is classified before anything acts on it — see
//! [`AuthFailure`](core::AuthFailure) for the rule and [`backoff`] for what
//! happens to the failures that told us nothing. The short version: a 401 is
//! the only thing in this module that may ever destroy a credential.
//!
//! **Token material never leaves this module.** The session token is the user's
//! whole account, and the renderer runs with no CSP while displaying
//! agent-authored markdown, so neither the session token nor the access JWT is
//! ever handed across the IPC boundary — the frontend receives [`AuthSnapshot`],
//! which carries no credentials. Nothing here logs a token or a device code.
